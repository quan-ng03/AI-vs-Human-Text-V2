# AI-vs-Human-Text-V2
Welcome to my data project! This time, I extended my research to find out which machine learning model is most capable of detecting Human and AI text and used different extracting techniques to compare which one is the best!
At the end of the description, I also explain how my model is not ready for live use yet but in most cases, it should work!
