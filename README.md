# AI-vs-Human-Text-V2
Welcome to my data project! This time, I extended my research to find out which machine learning model is most capable of detecting Human and AI text and used different extracting techniques to compare which one is the best! The project is written in Python and I utilized the Corpus library for tokenizing text.

Initially, I believed that using the Logistic Regression machine learning model would perform the best due to its best in binary classification datasets but I decided to compare it with two other models: Naive Bayes and Decision Tree to test its performance. Apart from choosing the models, I also performed different training-testing proportions to find the best that could result in the highest accuracy.

At the end of the description, I also explain how my model is not ready for live use yet but in most cases, it should work!
